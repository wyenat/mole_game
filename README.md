# mole_game

## About

The goal of this game is to click on moles ![](<./images/mole32.png>) to make them disappear.
However, when you click on one, her neighbors change their state. (mix of curiosity and fear, however I'm not mole expert)

It also has some features to help you, such as generating the tree of all state visited, generating a solution if you can't do it by yourself (very likely), allow you to rewind your actions, rewind your rewing...

## Requirements
python3
python3-tkinter

## How to run
Execute `main.py`, or `python3 main.py`

Should look like ![](<./images/screenshot4x4.png>)
